Project 3. Mental Health in Tech. 
This dataset is from a 2014 survey that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace. 
 Mental Health Survey (note, there are two sheets in the workbook). 
 I have cleaned the dataset overall and tied it up for all the main points.
